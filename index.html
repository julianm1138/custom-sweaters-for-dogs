          I make custom pet clothes for a perfect and comfortable fit. So your
          dog is ðŸ˜€ & warm! I understand what it's like to have a dog with
          unique body dimensions. If you give me measurements I can make
          perfectly tailored clothes for your dog. I up-cycle clothes and I have
          many different colors and different prints of fabric. I hand stitch
          the cuffs, with an invisible seam. So when you put my coat on your dog
          their nails will not get caught on thread from the seams. I believe in
          up cycling to help the environment so I make dog coats from old
          clothes. I even use notions from old purses, buttons, D-ring clips,
          zippers, & ribbons. Each outfit is uniquely designed.

          is smooth and soft. He prances when we put it on him. He also has a
          lighter weight fleece coat for cool days. It is so easy to slip over
          his head and velcro around his underside."
