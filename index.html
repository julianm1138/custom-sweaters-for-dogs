        <h2>About Our Coats</h2>
        <p class="about-p">
          I make custom pet clothes for a perfect and comfortable fit. So your
          dog is üòÄ & warm! I understand what it's like to have a dog with
          unique body dimensions. If you give me measurements I can make
          perfectly tailored clothes for your dog. I up-cycle clothes and I have
          many different colors and different prints of fabric. I hand stitch
          the cuffs, with an invisible seam. So when you put my coat on your dog
          their nails will not get caught on thread from the seams. I believe in
          up cycling to help the environment so I make dog coats from old
          clothes. I even use notions from old purses, buttons, D-ring clips,
          zippers, & ribbons. Each outfit is uniquely designed.

            "Pablo loves his hunting vest! It fits perfectly and the fleece
            lining is smooth and soft. He prances when we put it on him. He also
            has a lighter weight fleece coat for cool days. It is so easy to
            slip over his head and velcro around his underside."

            "My dog Zora absolutely loves her sweaters, they are custom sized
            and fit her perfectly. They keep her warm and cozy in the cold
            weather and are very stylish. I get tons of compliments from people
            who see Zora in her sweaters while we are walking. I only get her
            sweaters from here, because the quality is outstanding!" - Stephanie

            "These dog coats are beautiful! ü§© They are hand made with such
            beautiful craftsmanship and quality! I love them and my dogs
            appreciate the fact that they even thought of the sleeves being made
            with the dewy claws in mind so that they can easily slip into each
            sleeve without having to worry about them getting caught! Thank you
            üôè so much for the beautiful work and design of them! üôèü•∞üôèü•∞" -
